                <p>Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with
                    complex
                    topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a
                    scale-free
                    power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i)
                    networks
                    expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to
                    sites
                    that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed
                    stationary
                    scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by
                    robust
                    self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.

                <p>Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples
                    include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network
                    of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been
                    modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real
                    networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in
                    the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and
                    dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the
                    authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and
                    scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology
                    and the network’s robustness against failures and attacks.
